i had alot of fun exploring this dataset with @ALEXTHEANALYST, in the nutshell what i learnt is that EDA is just a way for you to get to know your Data just like you would with a new friend,
to get acquainted,ask questions,discover patterns and insights and more, all to help you understand the dataset better before making big decisions or building models.
